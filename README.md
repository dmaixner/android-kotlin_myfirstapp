# MyFirstApp

Simple Android app in Kotlin, making HTTP requests with [Volley](https://github.com/google/volley), [Cronet](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/cronet) and [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp).

There is also simple transition from one activity to another with clicking on the button.
